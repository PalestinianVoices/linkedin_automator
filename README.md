# ðŸ¤– Linkedin Automator

A Python library to automate various operations on LinkedIn posts, comments, and replies. So far, it supports the following features:
- Viewing all comments on posts (as well as last two replies) for each comment
- Deleting a comment or more given their links
- Deleting comments written by specific users across a number of posts

The last feature has been our main motivation for making this package since LinkedIn does not allow pages to block users from commenting on their posts.

### ðŸš€ Installation
```
pip install linkedin-automator
```
